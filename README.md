Designed and developed an interactive web application that evaluates the strength of user-generated passwords in real time. The application analyzes input based on character variety, length, and entropy estimation to classify passwords as weak, moderate, or strong. It features a dynamic strength bar with visual feedback, real-time cracking time estimation, and suggestions for improvement.

The interface is inspired by Matrix-style aesthetics, incorporating custom animations, neon glow effects, and interactive transitions for an engaging user experience. Key usability enhancements include a show/hide password toggle, responsive layout, and intuitive error handling for poor password choices.

This tool promotes cybersecurity awareness by educating users on what makes a password strong, helping them create better credentials to stay safe online.
